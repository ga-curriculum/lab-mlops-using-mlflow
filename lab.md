## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

-   ✅ Set up a basic ML project environment on our AWS Workspace.
-   ✅ Use MLflow to track and log parameters, metrics, and artifacts during model training.
-   ✅ Package a trained machine learning model using MLflow's standard model format.
-   ✅ Create a simple REST API using Flask to serve predictions from an MLflow-packaged model.
-   ✅ Understand the basic workflow of deploying a model in a simplified manner.
-   ✅ Run and test a model-serving API locally.
-   ✅ Gain practical experience with core MLOps concepts, including experiment tracking, model versioning, and simplified deployment.
-   ✅ Relate the hands-on lab activities to the theoretical concepts learned in the "AI Model Deployment" and "MLOps Fundamentals" lessons.

**Lab Environment:**

-   AWS Jupyter instance with Python 3.11.9.
-   We will be using a public dataset.
-   **Important:** We will run the Flask server in the background within the Jupyter instance for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, you would deploy it separately.

**Scenario:**

We will build a simplified MLOps pipeline for a customer churn prediction model for a telecommunications company, putting into practice the concepts learned in the previous lessons.  We'll focus on the *why* behind each step, not just the *how*.

## Lab Outline:

**(Total Time: 90 minutes)**

**Part 1: Introduction, Dataset Overview, and Setup**

- **Introduction**

    *   **Overview:** We're going to build a practical and simplified, MLOps pipeline.  Our goal is to take a machine learning model from development to a basic deployment, focusing on experiment tracking, model versioning, and serving predictions.

    *   **MLflow's Role:** We'll use MLflow as our central tool.  Think of MLflow as a toolbox that helps us manage the lifecycle of our machine learning model. We'll use it to:
        *   **Track Experiments:**  Record different model training runs, parameters, and results.  This is like keeping a detailed lab notebook.
        *   **Package Models:**  Create a standardized, reusable format for our trained model.  This makes it easier to deploy.
        *   **Deploy (Simplified):**  We'll create a simple web service to serve predictions.

    *   **Connecting to Prior Knowledge:**  This lab builds directly on the concepts you've learned about "AI Model Deployment" and "MLOps Fundamentals." We're putting theory into action!

- **Why Jupyter Notebooks and Python Scripts? (5 minutes)**

    In this lab, we'll be using a combination of Jupyter Notebooks and standalone Python scripts.  This is a common and important pattern in real-world MLOps workflows. Here's why:

    *   **Jupyter Notebooks: The Interactive Workbench**

        *   **Exploration and Rapid Prototyping:** Jupyter Notebooks are fantastic for interactive data exploration, visualization, and quick experimentation. You can see the results of your code immediately, making it easy to iterate and refine your ideas.
        *   **Documentation and Demonstrations:** Notebooks combine code, results, visualizations, and explanatory text (like this!). This makes them great for documenting your work and sharing it with others.
        *   **Limitations for Production:** Notebooks are generally *not* ideal for production code due to version control difficulties, automation challenges, and potential for hidden state (where the order of cell execution matters, leading to irreproducible results).

    *   **Python Scripts: The Production Workhorses**

        *   **Reproducibility and Automation:** Standalone Python scripts are designed for reproducibility and automation. They run the same way every time, making them suitable for scheduled tasks and automated pipelines.
        *   **Version Control Friendly:** Python scripts are plain text files, making them easy to track with version control systems like Git. This allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed.
        *   **Modularity and Reusability:** Scripts encourage modular code and reusable functions. You can break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces, making your code easier to understand, test, and maintain.

    *   **The Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds**

        In this lab, we'll use a hybrid approach:

        1.  **Exploration and Setup in Jupyter:** Initial setup, data loading, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be done in a Jupyter Notebook for interactive convenience.
        2.  **Model Training in a Python Script (`train.py`):** The core model training logic will be encapsulated in a standalone Python script. This ensures that the training process is reproducible and can be easily automated.
        3.  **Model Serving in a Python Script (`serve.py`):** We'll create another Python script to deploy our model as a simple web service.  This script will be self-contained and runnable.
        4.  **Interaction and Visualization in Jupyter:** We'll use the Jupyter Notebook to interact with the MLflow UI, run the training script, and test the deployment.

    This approach gives us the flexibility of Jupyter for exploration and the robustness of Python scripts for production-oriented tasks.

- **Dataset Overview: Telco Customer Churn (8 minutes)**

    We'll be working with the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). The goal is to predict which customers are likely to churn (leave the company).

    **Context:** The dataset comes from IBM Sample Data Sets and is a common dataset for practicing classification tasks.

    **Content:**

    *   **Each row represents a customer.**
    *   **Each column represents an attribute of that customer.**

    **Key Features (Columns):**

    *   `customerID`: A unique identifier for each customer (we'll drop this – it's not useful for prediction).
    *   `gender`:  The customer's gender (Male/Female).
    *   `SeniorCitizen`: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
    *   `Partner`: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes/No).
    *   `Dependents`: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes/No).
    *   `tenure`:  The number of months the customer has been with the company.
    *   `PhoneService`: Whether the customer has phone service (Yes/No).
    *   `MultipleLines`: Whether the customer has multiple phone lines (Yes/No/No phone service).
    *   `InternetService`: The type of internet service (DSL/Fiber optic/No).
    *   `OnlineSecurity`:  Whether the customer has online security (Yes/No/No internet service).
    *   `OnlineBackup`: Whether the customer has online backup (Yes/No/No internet service).
    *   `DeviceProtection`: Whether the customer has device protection (Yes/No/No internet service).
    *   `TechSupport`: Whether the customer has tech support (Yes/No/No internet service).
    *   `StreamingTV`: / `StreamingMovies`: Whether the customer has streaming TV/Movies (Yes/No/No internet service).
    *   `Contract`: The type of contract (Month-to-month/One year/Two year).
    *   `PaperlessBilling`: Whether the customer uses paperless billing (Yes/No).
    *   `PaymentMethod`:  The payment method (Electronic check/Mailed check/Bank transfer (automatic)/Credit card (automatic)).
    *   `MonthlyCharges`: The customer's monthly charges.
    *   `TotalCharges`: The total charges over the customer's tenure.
    *   `Churn`: The target variable: whether the customer churned (Yes/No).  This is what we want to predict.

    **Data Preprocessing:**  Before we can train a model, we'll need to prepare the data.  This will involve:

    *   **Dropping `customerID`:** As mentioned, this column is not relevant for prediction.
    *   **Handling `TotalCharges`:** This column has some missing values (represented as spaces). We'll convert it to a numeric type and fill the missing values with the mean.
    *   **One-Hot Encoding Categorical Features:**  Many machine learning algorithms work best with numerical data. We'll convert categorical features (like `gender`, `InternetService`, etc.) into a numerical representation using one-hot encoding. This creates new binary columns for each category.
    *   **Label Encoding the Target Variable ('Churn'):** Convert 'Yes'/'No' to 1/0.
    *   **Scaling Numerical Features:**  We'll scale numerical features (like `tenure` and `MonthlyCharges`) to a similar range.  This helps some algorithms (like Logistic Regression) perform better.

-   **Environment Setup**

    In this section, we'll set up the development environment for our MLOps project.  We'll create a dedicated project directory, a virtual environment, install the necessary libraries, and launch Jupyter Notebook.  These steps are crucial for ensuring reproducibility and avoiding conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

    *   **Activities:**

         1.  **Create a New Notebook**
            *   On Jupyter, go to the `lab4.3` subfolder
            *   Click the "New" button (usually on the right-hand side).
            *   Select "Python 3 (ipykernel)" (or the appropriate kernel if it's named differently). This creates a new notebook file.
            *   Rename the notebook: Click on "Untitled" at the top of the page and give it a descriptive name like `mlops_lab`.

**Part 2: Data Exploration (10 minutes)**

- **Activities:**
    - Download and load the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
    - Perform basic data exploration (`head()`, `info()`, `describe()`, `isnull().sum()`).
- **Key Learning:** Explore the dataset interactively to understand its structure, data types, and potential issues (like missing values). This is a crucial first step in any ML project.

- **Code (in Jupyter Notebook):**
    ```python
    # Cell 1: Create directories (if they don't exist)
    !mkdir -p data

    # Cell 2: Download the Data from Iguazio S3 (using wget)
    !wget --no-verbose https://iguazio-sample-data.s3.amazonaws.com/datasets/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv -O data/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv

    # Cell 3: Load and Explore Data
    import pandas as pd

    # Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
    data = pd.read_csv("data/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv")

    # Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
    print("First 5 rows:\n", data.head())

    # Check for missing values in each column
    print("\nMissing values per column:\n", data.isnull().sum())

    # Get basic information about the DataFrame (data types, non-null counts)
    print("\nData Info:\n")
    data.info()

    # Get descriptive statistics for numerical columns
    print("\nDescriptive Statistics:\n", data.describe())

    # --- Interactive Exploration and Questions ---
    # Q: What do you notice about the data? Are there any missing values?  Where?
    # Q: What data types are present in each column?  Which features will need preprocessing?
    # Q: Look at the descriptive statistics.  Do the ranges of values make sense?  Any outliers?
    # Q: What's the distribution of the target variable ('Churn')?  Is it balanced? (Use data['Churn'].value_counts())
    ```

**Part 3: Model Training and Experiment Tracking**

- **Section A: Standalone Python Script for Model Training**
    - **Activities:**
        - **Create `train.py`:**  *On the same folder (`lab4.3`)*, Click "New" -> "New text File" and changed the default name (`untitled.txt`) to: `train.py` and open it with right click over it and clicking "Open"
        - Develop and run `train.py`:
            - Load and preprocess data (all preprocessing steps from the overview).
            - Split data into training and testing sets.
            - Train a Logistic Regression model (a good baseline model).
            - Use MLflow to log parameters, metrics, and the trained model.
    - **Key Learning:** Write production-ready code for model training and integrate with MLflow for experiment tracking and model management.  This emphasizes the separation of concerns between exploration (notebook) and reproducible training (script).
    - **Code (`train.py`):**  Paste the following code into the `train.py` file you just created.

        ```python
        import mlflow
        import pandas as pd
        from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
        from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
        from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder
        import os

        # --- Data Loading and Preprocessing (Modularized) ---

        def load_and_preprocess_data(data_path):
            """Loads, preprocesses, and returns the Telco Churn dataset."""
            data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

            # 1. Drop unnecessary columns
            data = data.drop(['customerID'], axis=1)

            # 2. Convert TotalCharges to numeric and handle missing values
            data['TotalCharges'] = pd.to_numeric(data['TotalCharges'], errors='coerce')
            data['TotalCharges'].fillna(data['TotalCharges'].mean(), inplace=True)  # Impute with mean

            # 3. One-Hot Encode Categorical Features
            categorical_cols = data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns.drop('Churn') # Exclude target
            data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=categorical_cols, drop_first=True)

            # 4. Label Encode the Target Variable
            label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
            data['Churn'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(data['Churn'])


            return data

        def split_data(data, target_column):
            """Splits data into features (X) and target (y)."""
            X = data.drop(target_column, axis=1)
            y = data[target_column]
            return X, y

        # --- Main Script Execution ---

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            data_path = "data/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv"

            if not os.path.isfile(data_path):
                print(f"Error: Data file not found at {data_path}")
                exit()  # Exit cleanly if the data file is missing

            # Load and preprocess the data
            try:
                data = load_and_preprocess_data(data_path)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error during data loading and preprocessing: {e}")
                exit()

            # Split the data into features and target
            try:
                X, y = split_data(data, "Churn")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error during data splitting: {e}")
                exit()


            # Split data into training and testing sets
            X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

            # Scale numerical features
            scaler = StandardScaler()
            X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
            X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

            # --- MLflow Experiment Tracking ---

            with mlflow.start_run():
                # Define hyperparameters
                params = {
                    "penalty": "l2",  # Regularization type
                    "C": 0.1,         # Inverse of regularization strength

                }

                # Log parameters to MLflow
                mlflow.log_params(params)

                # Train the Logistic Regression model
                model = LogisticRegression(**params)  # Use the parameters defined above
                model.fit(X_train, y_train)

                # Make predictions on the test set
                y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

                # Evaluate the model
                accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
                precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
                recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
                f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

                # Log metrics to MLflow
                mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
                mlflow.log_metric("precision", precision)
                mlflow.log_metric("recall", recall)
                mlflow.log_metric("f1", f1)

                # Log the trained model to MLflow
                mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")

                # Print evaluation results to the console
                print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
                print(f"Model precision: {precision:.4f}")
                print(f"Model recall: {recall:.4f}")
                print(f"Model F1-score: {f1:.4f}")
        ```
    - Don't forget to save the file after pasting it.
    - **Run `train.py`:** Go back to your Jupyter Notebook (`mlops_lab.ipynb`).  We'll run the script from a notebook cell.  **Make sure your virtual environment is activated in the terminal where you launched Jupyter.**

        ```python
        # Cell 4: Run the training script (from the notebook)
        !python train.py
        ```

    - Wait about 30 seconds to get the results 

**Model Evaluation Metrics (train.py output)**

These numbers tell you how well your trained model performs on the test data (data the model hasn't seen during training). Here's what each metric means:

- **Accuracy:** The overall percentage of correct predictions (both churn and non-churn). In this case, the model is correct about 82.11% of the time.
Precision: Focuses on the positive predictions (predictions of "churn"). It answers the question: "Out of all the customers the model predicted would churn, what percentage actually churned?" For example, a precision of 0.6873 means that 68.73% of the customers predicted to churn actually did.
- **Recall:** Also focuses on churn, but from a different perspective. It answers: "Out of all the customers who actually churned, what percentage did the model correctly identify?" For example, a recall of 0.5952 means the model correctly identified 59.52% of the customers who churned.
- **F1-score:** A balanced measure that combines precision and recall. It's useful when you want to consider both false positives and false negatives. An F1-score of 0.6379 represents a reasonable balance between precision and recall in this case, for example.


*   **Section B: MLflow UI and Experiment Exploration in Jupyter**
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Launch the MLflow UI *in a separate terminal*.
        *   Guide learners through exploring the logged runs (parameters, metrics, artifacts).
        *   Demonstrate changing hyperparameters in `train.py`, re-running the script, and refreshing the MLflow UI to see the impact.
    *   **Key Learning:** Visualize the impact of different hyperparameters on model performance. Use the MLflow UI to compare different runs and understand the experiment tracking process.  Learn the importance of running long-running processes like web servers in a separate terminal for stability and responsiveness of the Jupyter Notebook.
    *   **Commands (in a SEPARATE TERMINAL):**

        1.  **Open a New Terminal and access to the container:** 
            ```bash
            sudo docker exec -it sa-course-labs bash
            ```
        2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
              Make sure you are in the `lab4.3` directory where you created your environment and scripts.
            ```bash
            cd lab4.3
            ```
        3.  **Launch the MLflow UI:**
            ```bash
            mlflow ui --host 0.0.0.0
            ```

    *   **Interactive Exploration:**

        1.  **Access the MLflow UI:** Open a new browser tab and go to `http://localhost:5000`. 
        2.  **Explore the UI:**
            *   Show the list of runs.
            *   Click on a run to see its details: parameters, metrics, artifacts (including the `model` directory).
            *   Explain the meaning of each section.
        3.  **Modify `train.py`:** Open the `train.py` file *using the Jupyter file browser*. Change the value of the `C` parameter (e.g., from 0.1 to 1.0) in the `params` dictionary. *Save the changes*.
        4.  **Re-run `train.py`:** Execute the cell with `!python train.py` again.
        5.  **Refresh the MLflow UI:** Go back to the MLflow UI browser tab and refresh the page.
        6.  **Compare Runs:** Select the two runs (the original and the modified one) and click "Compare." This will show a side-by-side comparison of the parameters and metrics.
        7.  **Repeat:** Try changing other hyperparameters (e.g., `solver`, `penalty`) and observe the effects.

        **Guiding Questions:**

        *   "How does changing the regularization strength (`C`) affect the model's performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)?"
        *   "What happens if you use a different solver (e.g., `lbfgs`)?"
        *   "Can you find a combination of hyperparameters that improves the F1-score?"
        *   "What does the 'model' artifact contain?  How is it organized?" (Click on the "model" artifact in the UI to explore its contents.)
        *   "Why is it important to track these parameters and metrics?" (Connect to the concepts of reproducibility and model selection.)


# Part 4: Model Packaging and Deployment

- **Section A: Packaging the Model (5 minutes)**

    - **Activities:**
        - Discuss the MLflow Model format and its benefits (portability, reproducibility).
        - Review the structure of the `model` directory created by `mlflow.sklearn.log_model()`.
    - **Key Learning:** Understand how MLflow packages a model for deployment, including the role of files like `MLmodel`, `model.pkl`, and `requirements.txt`. This section explains *what* MLflow did when we logged the model.
    - **Discussion (Instructor-Led):**

        *   **MLflow Model Format: A Universal Package**

            Begin by explaining the *concept* before diving into details.

            > "Think of the MLflow Model format as a universal, self-contained package for your machine learning model.  It's like a container that holds not just the model itself, but also everything needed to run it *anywhere* that supports MLflow.  This solves a major problem in MLOps:  how do you move a model from your training environment (like your Jupyter Notebook) to a completely different environment (like a web server or a batch processing system) and ensure it works exactly the same way?  MLflow's standard format is the answer."

        *   **Why a Standard Format?**

            > "Without a standard format, deploying models is a nightmare.  You'd have to manually keep track of the exact library versions, the specific way the model was saved, and how to load it.  MLflow takes care of all of this for you."

        *   **Key Components (Explain each one):**

            Now, break down the components, providing clear explanations and relating them back to the overall concept:

            *   **`MLmodel` (The Blueprint):**

                > "The `MLmodel` file is like the blueprint or manifest for your packaged model. It's a YAML file, which is a human-readable text format.  This file doesn't contain the model itself (the trained weights), but it *describes* the model in detail.  It tells MLflow *how* to load and use the model.  It's the instruction manual."

                *   **Flavor:**

                    > "The 'flavor' tells MLflow what kind of model this is.  Is it a scikit-learn model (`sklearn`)?  A TensorFlow model (`tensorflow`)?  A PyTorch model (`pytorch`)?  Knowing the flavor is crucial because each framework has its own way of loading and running models.  MLflow uses the flavor to know which loading mechanism to use."

                *   **Signature (The Input/Output Contract):**

                    > "The 'signature' is incredibly important for reliable deployments. It defines the *contract* for your model's inputs and outputs.  Think of it like a function definition in code: it specifies what data types the model expects as input (e.g., integers, floats, strings) and what data types it will produce as output.  This is critical for preventing errors.  If you try to send the wrong kind of data to your deployed model, the signature will catch it, and MLflow can raise an error *before* trying to make a prediction."

                    > "For example, if your model expects a numerical feature called 'monthly_charges', the signature will specify that this input should be a float. If you accidentally send a string, the signature will flag the error."

                *   **Environment (The Dependency List):**

                    > "The 'environment' section tells MLflow what Python libraries and versions are needed to run this model. This ensures *reproducibility*.  It lists all the dependencies, so when you deploy the model somewhere else, MLflow knows exactly what to install to recreate the training environment.  This information is usually stored in the `requirements.txt` file, and the `MLmodel` file points to it."

            *   **`model.pkl` (The Trained Model - scikit-learn specific):**

                > "For scikit-learn models, `model.pkl` is the file that actually contains your *trained* model.  It's created using Python's `pickle` library, which is a way to serialize (save) Python objects to a file.  When you call `mlflow.sklearn.log_model()`, it uses `pickle` behind the scenes to save your trained scikit-learn model into this `model.pkl` file.  When you load the model later, MLflow will use `pickle` to load it back into memory."

                > **Important Note:** "Different model flavors might save the model weights differently. For example, TensorFlow models often use the SavedModel format, which is a directory, not a single file. The `MLmodel` file handles these differences; you don't usually need to worry about the specifics of how each flavor stores the model itself."

            *   **`requirements.txt` (The Environment Details):**

                > "This file specifies the exact Python environment needed to run your model. It lists all the required Python packages (like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `mlflow`, etc.) and their specific versions. `requirements.txt` is used with `pip`.  MLflow can use either one. The important thing is that this file ensures that your deployment environment has all the necessary dependencies, and that they are the *same versions* used during training. This avoids the dreaded 'it works on my machine' problem."

        *   **Benefits of the MLflow Model Format:** (Reinforce these)

            *   **Portability:**  You can load and use the model in diverse environments.
            *   **Reproducibility:**  The environment is precisely defined.
            *   **Version Control:** The entire package is easily tracked.

        *   **Show the Files:**  Use the Jupyter file browser (or the terminal) to navigate into the `mlruns` directory, find the latest run ID, and then open the `model` directory.  Show the students the `MLmodel`, `model.pkl`, and `requirements.txt` files, and *relate the contents of the files back to the explanations you just gave*.  For example, open `MLmodel` and point out the `flavors`, `signature`, and `env` sections. Open `requirements.txt` and show the list of packages.

- **Section B: Creating a Flask-based Serving API**
    - **Activities:**
      - **Create `serve.py`:** *Within the Jupyter Notebook interface*, use the file browser to navigate to the `lab04` directory. Click "New" -> "Text File". Rename the file to `serve.py`.
        - Develop `serve.py`:
            - Load the latest trained model from MLflow using `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model()`.
            - Set up a Flask API with a `/predict` endpoint.
            - Convert the incoming JSON request data into a pandas DataFrame.
            - Use the loaded model to make predictions on the DataFrame.
            - Return the predictions as a JSON response.
    - **Key Learning:** Deploy a trained model as a simple REST API using Flask and MLflow. This is a fundamental step in making a model accessible for use.
    - **Code (`serve.py`):** Paste the following code into the newly created `serve.py` file.

        ```python
        from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
        import mlflow.pyfunc
        import pandas as pd

                print("Error: MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI environment variable not set.")
                return None

            mlflow.set_tracking_uri(mlflow_tracking_uri)
            
            runs = mlflow.search_runs(
                filter_string="metrics.accuracy > 0.5",
                order_by=["metrics.accuracy DESC"],
                max_results=1,
            )

            model_uri = f"runs:/{run_id}/model"
            return mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri)

        ```

- **Section C: Testing the Deployment)**

    - **Activities:**
        - Launch the Flask server in a *separate* terminal.
        - Use Jupyter Notebook (or the same terminal) to run `curl` commands or a Python script (using the `requests` library) to send test data to the `/predict` endpoint.
        - Review the JSON response from the API and check if the predictions are reasonable.
        - Troubleshoot any errors that occur.

    - **Key Learning:** Validate the entire pipeline, from model training to deployment, by sending requests to the serving API and checking the results. This confirms that the model is working correctly in a deployed environment.

    - **Instructions:**

        1.  **Open a New Terminal and access to the container:** 
            ```bash
            sudo docker exec -it sa-course-labs 
            ```
        2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
              Make sure you are in the `lab4.3` directory where you created your environment and scripts.
            ```bash
            cd lab4.3
            ```
            * **Set the MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI Environment Variable:**
                ```bash
                export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://127.0.0.1:5000"
                ```
            *   Run the Flask server:
                ```bash
                python serve.py
                ```
                You should see output indicating that the Flask server is running, similar to:
                ```
                * Serving Flask app 'serve'
                * Debug mode: on
                * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5001
                ...
                ```
                **Leave this terminal window open.**  The server needs to keep running to handle requests.

        2.  **Test the Deployment (from Jupyter Notebook or the Terminal):**

            Now, you can use *either* `curl` directly in the terminal or over a Jupyter Notebook, adding `!` to curl to test it:

            ```bash
            curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[{"SeniorCitizen":0,"tenure":1,"MonthlyCharges":29.85,"TotalCharges":29.85,"Partner_Yes":1,"Dependents_Yes":0,"PhoneService_Yes":0,"MultipleLines_No phone service":1,"MultipleLines_Yes":0,"OnlineSecurity_No internet service":0,"OnlineSecurity_Yes":0,"OnlineBackup_No internet service":0,"OnlineBackup_Yes":1,"DeviceProtection_No internet service":0,"DeviceProtection_Yes":0,"TechSupport_No internet service":0,"TechSupport_Yes":0,"StreamingTV_No internet service":0,"StreamingTV_Yes":0,"StreamingMovies_No internet service":0,"StreamingMovies_Yes":0,"PaperlessBilling_Yes":1,"InternetService_DSL":0,"InternetService_Fiber optic":0,"InternetService_No":0,"Contract_One year":0,"Contract_Two year":0,"PaymentMethod_Credit card (automatic)":0,"PaymentMethod_Electronic check":1,"PaymentMethod_Mailed check":0}]' http://127.0.0.1:5001/predict
            ```


        3. Understanding the Output:

          The output [1.0] is a JSON array containing a single prediction.  Since our model is a binary classifier for churn prediction (will the customer churn or not?), the output represents the model's prediction for the input data you provided:

          1.0: Represents the model predicting "Yes, the customer will churn" (positive class).
          0.0: Would represent the model predicting "No, the customer will not churn" (negative class).
          The Logistic Regression model, by default in scikit-learn, outputs the predicted class label (0 or 1) directly, not probabilities.  We're using this default 
          behavior in our serve.py for simplicity.
          
        4.  **Troubleshooting and Discussion:**

            *   **Instructor:**  Ask questions to guide the students through the testing process.
            *   "What prediction did you get? Does it seem reasonable given the input data?"
            *   "What happens if you send data in the wrong format (e.g., missing a column, wrong data type)?"
            *   "How could you make the API more robust (e.g., add input validation, better error handling)?"
            *   **If there are errors:** Guide students through debugging. Common issues include:
                *   **Server not running:** Make sure the `serve.py` script is still running in the separate terminal.
                *   **Incorrect URL:** Double-check the IP address and port (should be `127.0.0.1:5001` for local testing, or the instance's public IP and port 5001 for remote testing).
                *   **Incorrect data format:**  The input JSON *must* match the format expected by the model after preprocessing (one-hot encoded). Refer back to the `train.py` script to see how the data was preprocessed.
                * **Environment variable not set**: Ensure it was set in the terminal were the server will run


**Part 5: Conclusion and Next Steps**

- **Recap:**
    - Briefly summarize the key takeaways from the lab:
        - Setting up a reproducible ML environment.
        - Using MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning.
